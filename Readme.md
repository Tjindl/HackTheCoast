## Matching Algorithm

The matching algorithm evaluates each award against the student's profile based on:

1. **Required criteria** (must match or award is excluded):

   - Citizenship status
   - Campus
   - Specific affiliations
   - Indigenous status (if required)
   - Disability status (if required)
   - Student loan requirement

2. **Preferred criteria** (affects match score):
   - Year of study
   - Faculty/program
   - GPA requirements
   - Gender
   - Financial need
   - Geographic location

Match scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating better matches.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement user accounts to save profiles and track applications
- Add email notifications for application deadlines
- Include ML-based recommendations based on similar successful applicants
- Add filtering and sorting options for results
